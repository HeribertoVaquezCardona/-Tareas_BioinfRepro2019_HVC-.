### RESULTS

## Vandeño: H-W Equilibrium Test.
I saved the matrix of this H-W Equilibrium Test in csv format. I uploaded that file (VaHWE.csv), but in avarage:
chi^2> 3.841.


## Chalqueño: H-W Equilibrium Test.
I saved the matrix of this H-W Equilibrium Test in csv format. I uploaded that file (ChHWE.csv), but in avarage:
chi^2> 3.841.


## DISCUSSION

In maize, the altitud is one of the most important factor to grow up. Usually, is complicated to them adaptaded to different altitud.
Vandeño and Chalqueño are two landraces of maize and they grow up in differents altitudes. Chalqueño is considered a highland landrace
and Vandeño a lowhighland landrace.

Vandeño belongs of the Dentados tropicales group of maize. In 1951, Wellhausen et al. described this landrace and proposed an
avarage of his common altitud:	0-500 amsl. But in this project, Vandeño samples have an collect altitud between 298 and 721 amsl.
The samples belong to 3 different periods of collect: before 1960, 1960-1980, and after 2000.
Considering the results of the HWE Test, I rejected the null model and the Vandeño popolution is not in H-W Equilibrium 
because chi^2> 3.841

Chalqueño	belongs of the Cónico gropu of maize.	The CONABIO (s/f) proposed the common altitud of this landrace up of 1800 amsl.
In this project, Vandeño samples have an collect altitud between 2247 and 2705 amsl.
The samples belong to 3 different periods of collect: before 1960, 1960-1980, and after 2000.
Considering the results of the HWE Test with significant statistical suppor, and the Chalqueño popolution is not in H-W Equilibrium 
because chi^2> 3.841

So, in both cases the altitud doesn's matters to don't have Hardy-Weingber Equilibrium.
