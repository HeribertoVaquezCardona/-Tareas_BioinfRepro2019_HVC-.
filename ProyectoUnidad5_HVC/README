Project U. 5 "Fst: Analisis of population genetics"
Autor: Heriberto Vazquez Cardona (Social Service: Institute of Ecology)

Objective:
This project creates Fst Analisis using maize (landraces) data. This Fst will calculates the population divergency between landraces of maize considering the altitude.

Repository:
This repository contains the 3 directories of this project.

data: contains raw data. Those are the output of GBS with landraces maize data. I got the data with my tutor.
meta: contains vcf data. GBS data became to vcf. I got the data with my tutor.
bin: contains the scripts to create the Fst.
Scripts
To run the scripts is necesary install Tassel5 and save the program in a tassel5 directory inside bin directory.

First and second scripts run with bash.

runtassel5.sh : works to come in the Tassel5 directory.
start_tassel.pl : it opens Tassel5.
Inside Tassel5: open /meta/368_Taxa_Rename_Plink_File.txt . Use the graphic interface to choose Filter, Taxa Names, and then select just the Landraces samples (with the key "Na" and then: Bo (Bolita), Ch (Chalqueño), Ms (Mushito), Pp (Pepitilla), Tb (Tabloncillo), Va (VAndeño), Zm (Zamorano). Without simpatry with "H" (modern varities)). Save the new file in VCF format: Zea_mays_7LR.vcf.

The next scripts use R to create the Fst (using hierfstat and adegenet)

convertVCFtogenlight.R : it converts Zea_mays_7LR.vcf (VCF file) to genlight file.
calculateFst.R : it calculates the Fst using the genlight file.
Fstplot.R : it makes the Fst plot.
