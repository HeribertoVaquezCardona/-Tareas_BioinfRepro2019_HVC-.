Project U. 5 "Fst: Analisis of population genetics"
Autor: Heriberto Vazquez Cardona (Social Service: Institute of Ecology)

Objective:
This project creates Fst Analisis using maize (landraces) data. This Fst will calculates the population divergency between landraces of maize considering the altitude.

Repository:
This repository contains the 3 directories of this project.

data: contains raw data. Those are the output of GBS with landraces maize data. I got the data with my tutor.
meta: contains vcf data. GBS data became to vcf. I got the data with my tutor.
bin: contains the scripts to create the Fst.
Scripts
To run the scripts is necesary install Tassel5 and save the program in a tassel5 directory inside bin directory.

First and second scripts run with bash.

runtassel5.sh : works to come in the Tassel5 directory.
start_tassel.pl : it opens Tassel5.
zipfileVCF.R : works to zip /data/filtered/"Zea_mays_7LR.vcf".
The next scripts use R to create the Fst.

convertVCFtogenlight.R : it converts Zea_mays_7LR.vcf (VCF file) to genlight file.
genlight2genind.R : it converts the genlight file to genind file.
calculateFst.R : it calculates the Fst using the genind file.
Fstplot.R : it makes the Fst plot.

Comments:
I don't have my own data, so for this project I use the tutor's data.
